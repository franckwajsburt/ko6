  \brief    CPU specific user functions 
            - This file contains cpu-dependant functions used by user applications. 
            - This functions could be static inline functions because or even macros,
              instead this is real code in .h file that is not very clean, 
              but I don't want theses functions inlined in order to see them in the trace execution
            - system calls 
            - FIXME spinlock or atomic add should be appeared.
