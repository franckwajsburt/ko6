/**
 * \brief   thread_bootstrap() function is the bootstrap of the thread.
 *          It means that it is the very first function we call when the thread_context_load()
 *          returns for the very first time. In fact, thread_context_load() ends with a "jr $31" 
 *          as usual but when we create a thread, $31 is initialized with the thread_bootstrap()
 *          address. Thus, when we return from thread_context_load() the very first time, we enter
 *          in thread_bootstrap(). The function thread_bootstrap() cannot have any argument,
 *          since thread_context_load() does not restore $4 to $7 registers (which are the 
 *          registers of arguments). So, that is the thread_bootstrap() itself that will call the
 *          threat_start() function with the needed arguments, as we know what is the current
 *          thread, and we are able to find out what is the user function to call with which args.
 *          As the thread is just beginning to run, its state is now RUNNING
 *
 *          To sum up what is happening when a thread context is loaded:
 *
 *          - the very first time that a thread is chosen by the scheduler
 *              thread_context_load (thread)                                   (def hcpua.S)
 *              - thread_bootstrap ()                                          (def kthread.c)
 *                - thread_launch (thread->fun, thread->arg, thread->start)    (def hcpua.S)
 *                  - thread->thread_start (thread->fun, thread->arg)          (def thread.c)
 *                    - thread->fun (thread->arg)                              (def uapp)
 *
 *          - the others times that a thread is chosen
 *              thread_context_load (thread)                                   (def hcpua.S)
 *              - return to sched_switch()                                     (def kthread.c)
 *                - return to the caller of sched_switch, 2 possibilities:
 *                  1. from a syscall
 *                     - return to the syscall function (e.g. tty_read)        (def harch.c)
 *                       - return to syscall_handler                           (def hcpua.S)
 *                         - return to the app that uses the syscall           (def app)
 *                  2. from a isr (here, only isr_timer)
 *                     - return to isrcall                                     (def harch.c)
 *                       - return to irq_handler                               (def hcpua.S)

/**
 * thread_wait() and thread_notify() are made to handle the WAIT state, please read both comments.
 * Use this function to put the current thread (say T0) into a WAIT state. We need this when T0
 * has just tried to acquire a busy resource. We assume that T0 has already been added to the
 * resource's waiting list, so we still need to detach T0 from its processor's availability list.
 * The problem is that the resource may become available during the state change of T0.
 * Suppose another thread (say T1) returns the resource and calls thread_notify(T0).
 * T1 is necessarily running on another CPU, so there is a risk that T0 will become READY
 * (because of the call to thread_notify(T0)) with the resource in its possession and then
 * become WAIT (because of the call to thread_wait() just after).
 * In this case, T0 will never notified again. This is the end.
 * there are two possibilities: A [ wait then notify ] or B [ notify then wait ]
 * A) That is the normal case. T0 is first detached from ready list,
 *    then secondly, T0 is notified and become READY
 * B) That is a abnormal case. T0 begins to notify, because T1 gives it the resource and
 *    calls thread_notify() then T0 becomes READY, but just after that T0 calls thread_wait()!
 *    Thus, thread_wait(), called by T0, must know that thread_notify() has already been called,
 *    it is simply possible by looking its state. If T0 is always RUNNING, then it means that
 *    thread_notify() has not been called yet, because otherwise the state would have been READY
 *    In that case T0 has to wait, otherwise T0 is READY and we DO NOT change the state
 *    The lock is to protect the sequence [ read - test - modification ]
 * Note that it is possible that the notify() occurs after unlocking and just before sched_switch().
 * In this case, T0 will be READY but will lose the CPU even if it owns the resource.
 * This is unfortunate, as the resource is locked for a quantum of time, but it is not fatal.
